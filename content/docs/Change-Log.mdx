## [5.2.9] - 2025-12-28


### 🐛 Fixed

##### Image Filters & Distortion
- **Fixed Perspective Distortion**: Completely rewrote perspective transform implementation
  - Replaced incorrect affine transform (only used 3 points) with proper homography matrix (uses all 4 points)
  - Added proper perspective transform using 3x3 homography matrix with bilinear interpolation
  - Fixed bounding box calculation to ensure transformed image stays within canvas bounds
  - Images now correctly transform to specified perspective points without going outside canvas dimensions
  
- **Fixed Pre-Filter Application**: Pre-filters now work correctly
  - Pre-filters were being applied to empty canvas (before image was drawn)
  - Now draws image to temporary canvas first, applies filters, then draws result to main canvas
  - All filters now work correctly in both 'pre' and 'post' filter order modes

- **Fixed Invert Filter**: Invert filter no longer causes image displacement or disappearance
  - Fixed dimension preservation issue where Sharp processing could change image dimensions
  - Added dimension verification and automatic resizing if dimensions don't match
  - Ensured alpha channel preservation throughout filter pipeline
  - Image now stays in correct position and maintains exact dimensions after inversion

- **Fixed Filter Parameter Usage**: Corrected all filter parameter types
  - **Use `intensity`**: gaussianBlur, sharpen, motionBlur, radialBlur, noise, grain, edgeDetection, emboss
  - **Use `value`**: brightness (-100 to 100%), contrast (-100 to 100%), saturation (-100 to 100%), hueShift (0-360 degrees)
  - **Special parameters**: posterize uses `levels` (2-256), pixelate uses `size` (2+), radialBlur uses `centerX/centerY`
  - Added comprehensive validation and value clamping for all filter parameters

## [5.0.4] - 2025-12-22

### ✨ Enhanced

##### Ultra-Smooth Line Rendering
- **Improved Smooth Path Algorithm**: Enhanced `createSmoothPath` function for graph-like smoothness
  - Increased resolution from 20 to 50 segments per curve for ultra-smooth rendering
  - Added high-quality anti-aliasing (`imageSmoothingQuality: 'high'`)
  - Optimized Cardinal Spline algorithm for better curve interpolation
  - Improved control point calculation for seamless transitions

- **Enhanced Catmull-Rom Spline**: Upgraded `createCatmullRomPath` for professional graph quality
  - Increased resolution from 30 to 60 segments per curve (graph-quality smoothness)
  - Fixed Catmull-Rom formula for correct tension handling
  - Added high-quality anti-aliasing for pixel-perfect rendering
  - Optimized spline interpolation for maximum smoothness

- **Anti-Aliasing Support**: Enabled high-quality image smoothing across all custom line rendering
  - Automatic anti-aliasing in `customLines` function
  - High-quality smoothing in both smooth and Catmull-Rom path types
  - Ensures graph-like smoothness with no visible segments or sharp edges

#### 🎯 Performance & Quality
- **Ultra-High Resolution Curves**: Lines now render with 50-60 segments per curve (previously 20-30)
- **Graph-Quality Smoothness**: Lines match the smoothness of professional graphing libraries
- **Optimized Tension Values**: Lower default tension (0.15-0.2) for maximum smoothness
- **Seamless Transitions**: Improved curve interpolation eliminates visible segments

#### 📝 Usage Improvements
- **Better Defaults**: Optimized tension values for graph-like smoothness
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated examples with recommended settings for ultra-smooth lines
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support for tension values 0.1-0.3 for different smoothness levels
